## Introduction

Wander Hub is a social media platform for travelers to share their adventures, discover new places, and connect with other travel lovers. The frontend is built using React, providing a fast, responsive, and interactive user experience.

Users can quickly sign up and log in to access their dashboard. They can create, view, edit, and delete their travel posts, as well as like and comment on other users posts. Users can follow others for updates and react to comments to enhance interaction.

They can also save favorite posts for later and update their profile information, such as their bio and avatar. The platform has search and filter options, allowing everyone to find content by title, username, region, or place. It is designed to work well on all devices, ensuring a smooth experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Wander Hub makes it easy for travelers to connect and share their experiences in a user-friendly way.

### Site Goals
Wander Hub aims to bring together travellers who want to share their adventures and discover new destinations. Whether it’s a quick weekend getaway or an international trip, users can post travel stories, share photos, and write about their experiences.

**Key Goals:**
- **Easy User Authentication:** Simplified sign-up and login with just a username and password, giving users access to a personalized dashboard.
- **CRUD Functionality for Travel Posts:** Registered users can create, view, edit, and delete their posts, giving them control over their content.
- **Engagement and Interaction:** Users can like and comment on posts, helping to build a community. They can also follow others to see their updates and manage their comments by creating, editing, or deleting them.
- **Comment Reactions:**  Users can react to comments (e.g., like or appreciate), enhancing interaction and feedback within the community.
- **Saved Posts for Future Reference:** Users can save favorite travel stories and destinations for easy access later.
- **Profile Management:** Logged-in users can update their profile details (bio, username, password, avatar), which are visible on all pages.
- **Advanced Search and Filter Options:** All users including those not logged in can explore content using search and filter features by title, username, region, or place.
- **Responsive Design:** The platform is optimized for all devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Scope
The design of Wander Hub is centred on key features and accessibility. The front-end is responsive and built with React, while the back-end uses Django Rest Framework. Users can create, manage, and interact with travel posts, while features like authentication, liking, commenting, and following others enhance engagement. The interface is designed to be simple and easy to use, with continuous adjustments based on testing and feedback to improve the overall experience.

### Structure
Wander Hub’s development is organized with clear milestones and user stories:
- **Milestones:** These cover major tasks, like setting up the backend, building the frontend, and implementing features such as login and post management, helping the project stay on track.
- **User Stories:** Tasks are broken down into smaller steps, focusing on features like creating and editing posts, managing profiles, and enabling users to comment and like posts. Priorities are set to focus on the most important features first.

This approach ensures the platform is built with the user’s needs in mind.

### Skeleton
The design is planned using wireframes and ERD that show how the database is organized:
- **Wireframes:** Visual sketches of important pages, like the homepage and user profiles, were created to ensure the layout is clear and easy to navigate.
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** These diagram map out how data is structured, showing how users, posts, comments, and followers relate to each other. This ensures everything works smoothly behind the scenes.
